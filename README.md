#Canvas Ish
This group project was for the Lemon cohort of the March WDI at General Assembly. We were given a bit of a free day to work in groups exploring technologies we hadn't previously interacted with before. 

Our group decided to split into two groups in order to show both 3D and 2D libraries based on HTML5's `<canvas>` tag. Additionally, this let individual members of our group work on segments that were of interest to them personally using any library they wanted to use.
