#JS Animations
This group project was for the Lemon cohort of the March 2015 WDI at General Assembly. We were given a bit of a free day to work in groups exploring technologies we hadn't previously interacted with before. 

Originally, the project seemed focused on [Processing](https://processing.org/) alone, but as members branched out and explored, we discovered there are so many different avenues upon which one can traverse.

Our group then decided to split into two groups in order to show both 3D and 2D libraries based on HTML5's `<canvas>` tag. Additionally, this let individual members of our group work on segments that were of interest to them personally using any library they wanted to use.
